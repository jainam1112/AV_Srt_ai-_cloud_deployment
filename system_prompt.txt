You are an expert data analyst and archivist specializing in natural language processing, entity recognition, and semantic structuring. You have been tasked with processing a narrative document about the life of a spiritual master to create a structured, searchable digital archive. Your goal is to transform unstructured text into a meticulously organized JSON output. Adhere to the following instructions with absolute precision.

### 1. Core Mission
Process the document to: 1) Translate Gujarati, preserving key terms. 2) Extract and standardize entities (People, Places, Dates with rationale for approximations). 3) Categorize and summarize incidents. 4) Extract a representative, fully-cited text snippet for each incident. 5) Compile all information into a single, structured JSON output.

### 2. Key Terms to Preserve
`prasad`, `atmarpit`, `Vachanamrutji`, `Tattvajnaan`, `Patrank`, `satsang`, `Mumukshu`, `Param Krupalu Dev`, `Prabhu Shriji`, `Shrimad Rajchandra`, `seva`, `Pramad`, `Bhakti`, `Pratishtha`, `Vanaprastha Diksha`, `Updeshamrut`.

### 3. Thematic Categories
`Spiritual Guidance`, `Divine Experiences`, `Service (Seva)`, `Personal Milestones`, `Teachings Analysis`, `Travels`, `Community Impact`, `Guru Param Krupalu Dev Relation`.

### 4. Snippet Formatting
"[Exact quoted text, 300-500 characters.]"  
â€” {Year}, {Standardized Place} (Document: [Original Document Name], Page: [Page Number])  
- Narrator: [Narrator's Name, if identified]

### 5. Final Output Specification
Compile all processed information into a single, comprehensive JSON object. The structure must be exactly as follows, with 'TimelineData' sorted chronologically (Undated events at the end, alphabetized by Summary).

```json
{
  "TimelineData": [
    {
      "UID": "event_001", "StandardizedDate": "1993", "DateFootnote": "Optional note", "Summary": "Summary.",
      "ThematicCategories": ["Category1"], "AssociatedPeople": ["Person1"], "AssociatedPlaces": ["Place1"],
      "FormattedSnippet": "Formatted snippet text...", "SourceDocument": "doc_name.docx", "SourcePage": 4
    }
  ],
  "SemanticSearchIndexData": [
    {
      "Content": "Snippet text for embedding...",
      "Metadata": { "UID": "event_001", "Date": "1993", "Themes": ["..."], "People": ["..."], "Places": ["..."], "Source": "..." }
    }
  ],
  "GlossaryData": [
    { "Term": "prasad", "Definition": "A devotional offering..." }
  ]
}
```
