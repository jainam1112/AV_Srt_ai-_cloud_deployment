Updeshchhaya-10, on Bhadarva Sud 15, 1952, at Vadva, Param Krupalu Dev states: The essence of all religions is... The essence of all religions is to experience the soul. All other spiritual means, wherever needed (are appropriate), when practised as per the enlightened one's command, bear fruit for the worthy soul. It is as if this Vachanamrut is elaborated in... I won't say book, now I will call it a scripture. In this scripture, Munishri has explained based on his own experience. A beautiful style of expression is also appealing, but it's as if every word is from his inner experience. And yet, he is nowhere in the book. That is wondrous - it is his experience, but... In earlier books, he would write: Mu. Amarendravijay. 'Until I reach the 6th - 7th stage of spiritual development, until there is abidance in the self, beyond thoughts, how am I a 'muni' - monk?' To have such a definition of a muni, while adorning the garbs of a muni, shows he was a lover of the soul. He did nothing just for the sake of society or public recognition. In our 'Puranas' - ancient legends, especially the Mahabharat, there is a saying: 'Dharmo rakshati rakshatah' - Dharma protects those who protect it. It is be found in the Manusmriti and in the Mahabharat, this aphorism holds an especially important place. And its meaning is: Dharma will protect you if you protect dharma. If dharma is woven into your life, in your thoughts and actions; if in life, it reflects in your state, then surely that dharma will protect you.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"books_contributed_to\": [\"And so, when I was asked to write the foreword, I said this is my good fortune!

On the basis of the external form, in short, the poppy-seeds - we create conflicts, we start discriminating. The actual essence lies in the inner form of dharma. Hence, Param Krupalu Dev writes: The essence of all religions... It must be dharma. Then the names of its external forms are not mentioned. The essence of all religions is to experience the soul. That's all. All spiritual means are negated? The answer is no! All other spiritual means, wherever appropriate, practise as per the enlightened one's command, then it will bear fruit for the worthy soul. In order to attain this fruit, meaning realising the soul, experiencing the self, to taste the soul in a state beyond thoughts, then one must have the correct determination of the fundamental truth. Because the task to be performed is only one: From being externally focused to soul focused. But no matter how much we resolve, due to lack of worthiness, being externally focused is not averted, even if we sit with closed eyes for three hours! Even if we sit in 'samayak' - Jain ritual. None of this is wrong, but my objective isn't achieved. So it is necessary to understand that the work is only this: go from externally focused to soul focused.

The instrumental cause will not do anything, but without it, it won't happen. This is very clear that all the effort must be made by you, but the main basis of that effort is the nectar-like words, countenance, and the association of the great ones. Now, it only says association. If such a small nectar-like teaching has to be written, why write 3? Do we get nectar-like words during association or not? And do we get to behold His countenance or not? Everything is included in the association of the great ones. It should be of the great ones, the great ones. \"Oh! This is what is unique in Shrimad's philosophy?\" Someone asked me. \"You'll don't study scriptures?\" I said, \"We do.\" \"You'll meditate?\" I said, \"We do.\" \"You'll perform austerities?\" I said, \"We do.\" \"Do you go on pilgrimages?\" I said, \"After 'Paryushan' - Jain festival, I have a vow for 57 years to visit one place of pilgrimage and one saint. I have followed it till now. I will go immediately.\" \"Oh, you'll do all that. Then what is so special about Shrimad's philosophy?\" We consider Sadguru higher than scriptures as well. The benevolence of a living Sadguru is not the same but greater than that of the non-present omniscient Lords. Even if the Sadguru is on a lower spiritual level than the author of the scriptures, who might be moving back and forth between the sixth and seventh level, and the one I have met maybe at the fourth level, I still value His benevolence more than the previous one.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"miscellaneous_personal_details\": [\"I said, \\\"After 'Paryushan' - Jain festival, I have a vow for 57 years to visit one place of pilgrimage and one saint.
