If you engage even in satsang in excess of what your inner readiness is, it will harm you. You may straightaway begin experiencing disinterest. So many times I want to give separation, \u201cDon\u2019t come, don\u2019t come.\u201d That separation may result in greater upliftment because his readiness begins developing. And if he comes to a satsang, he may say, \u201cI already know this.\u201d So you are stuck there. The 5th category is \u2018tivra mumukshu\u2019 \u2013 one intensely yearning for liberation. He insists on experience and nothing else. And that too, wants today itself. He has no such thing as \u2018over the years\u2019. \u2018I should experience it today itself.\u2019 So much\u2026 you can call it thirst, you can call it intense yearning for liberation. So, the first 2, \u2018darshak\u2019 and \u2018kutuhal\u2019, have no relation to religion, because they have not come for religion in the first place. One has come to enjoy the comforts, and one has come to evaluate. So those two have nothing to do with religion. And let\u2019s fuse the last two \u2013 since it\u2019s \u2018mumukshuta\u2019 and \u2018tivra mumukshuta\u2019, let\u2019s keep \u2018mumukshu\u2019 \u2013 seeker of liberation. So in short, there are 2 categories: 1. \u2018Jignasu\u2019 and 2. \u2018Mumukshu\u2019. This is not that \u2018jignasu\u2019 of Atmasiddhi Shastra. There, Param Krupalu Dev has said, \u201cI don\u2019t consider him \u2018jignasu\u2019 at all.\u201d \u201cIf he is a \u2018mumukshu\u2019, then only I can call him \u2018jignasu\u2019.\u201d So that is another thing, Atmsiddhiji speaks out\u2026 Param Krupalu Dev does not like to make it lengthy; everything is like the Upanishads \u2013 direct. That if you want to use the word \u2018jignasu\u2019 in a positive way, then it means \u2018atmarthi\u2019 \u2013 aspirant, it means \u2018mumukshu\u2019, only. All the other\u2026 \u2018I want to know, but I don\u2019t have the bubbling enthusiasm to do it\u2019, put those people aside, out. Because that\u2019s Atmasiddhiji. So, what are the 2 categories? 1. \u2018Jignasu\u2019 (2. \u2018Mumukshu\u2019.) Both ask questions, both listen to discourses, both read scriptures, but one just wants to increase knowledge. He feels fulfilment in just that much. And one wants to know - to transform. He wants to know - to transform. He wants to listen - to transform. He wants to read - to transform. This is a big difference. What do you truly desire? If you just have \u2018jignasa\u2019, if you only have \u2018jignasa\u2019, then it is said to not only be a waste, but can also be fatal.

To have such a definition of a muni, while adorning the garbs of a muni, shows he was a lover of the soul. He did nothing just for the sake of society or public recognition. In our 'Puranas' - ancient legends, especially the Mahabharat, there is a saying: 'Dharmo rakshati rakshatah' - Dharma protects those who protect it. It is be found in the Manusmriti and in the Mahabharat, this aphorism holds an especially important place. And its meaning is: Dharma will protect you if you protect dharma.

In MA, when I received a gold medal, I told my parents because they had only answered the call from the university. I didn't take anyone with me. I didn't want any proof also. I had even decided to donate the medal in the temple because... Of course, it is gold plated but to put it away. When I was about to put it, the priest stopped me, saying that nothing but money should be put there, So it stayed with me. And it was 10:30 in the night. So I came home. And Mummy asked, \\\"Where were You till 10:30 pm?\\\" So I had to show. I had to show proof to show that I hadn't gone to the disco. So I told them, \\\"Today, there was a parade in Rajabai Tower and all this happened,\\\" And it was broadcasted on Marathi news. Otherwise, there would not have been proof. And then I said, \\\"Tomorrow, I am going to go to Zaveri Bazaar, sell it and donate the money\\\". So she said, \\\"Sell it to me\\\". My mother gave me 5000 rupees at that time in 1991. So I said, \\\"Fine. I am concerned with\\r\\nthe money; you buy it\\\". So now it is with the organisation. I didn't take even one person. I didn't even inform one person, not even my parents, that today they are hosting an event and I have to go. Because my Guru has kept me very cautious about all these things. That in this way, it enters through in different forms. Now when I say it, I say it merely in jest. that I am an MA gold medallist, PhD. Not out of ego but in jest. If you get something, don't do anything at all. And whatever the organisation gets, the organisation gets. I don't associate myself with that. Because it's all your hard work, and the Mission is getting, whatever. And fine. When you leave seva, just don't make it wear the dress of religious words, instead say that my ego is not inflating here. That's why I am leaving seva. Because you find such people.\"]}"}]}

And that too, the inner intention is grasped because if the inner intention is grasped, only then will the enlightened one be recognised. Otherwise you will remain a beggar because discernment will not awaken in you. So, keep the habit of understanding the intention of the command, not the habit of asking for commands. Because after some time, your next phase will start when you are given separation. True love has not awakened; that is why separation is not given because then you will run to the world. You develop a little true love... What is it called? 'Modus operandi'? Am I saying it rightly? This is fixed; the eternal style of the enlightened ones - that love has awakened in him, now to send him to the second level, give separation. At that time, who will you ask for commands? As the intention behind the command is understood, discernment awakens accordingly. Due to your knowledge... Gradually, there will be no need to ask, and I see a lot in Nemiji. A lot in Nemiji. He will know what I will think, not only what I am thinking. So, of course, due to close acquaintance. More contribution of that, but he has always made a conscious attempt of, 'I want to ask lesser and lesser and be aligned to Him more and more.' But ask lesser and lesser.

From a worldly perspective, physical perspective, financial perspective, family perspective, whatever. 'If I break the command and be a little practical, then...' Benefit will be seen in breaking the command. An aspirant will not see that. Even a loss in following the command, he will see it as a profit. There was a watchman. What does he have to do?
